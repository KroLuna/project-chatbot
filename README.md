# Project chatbot

The asigment was to create a chatbot with functions we learn in week2. 

## The problem

The problem was to understand how to invoke or call functions, hor to connect them, I solve it by asking a lot of questions to chatCGT and youtube, google and more. This is the hardest project so far. I try different functions and moved around codes, they finally worked.
